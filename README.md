## Introduction

This is a simple API which supports Create and Read actions for User objects, which are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Users have a firstName and lastName, as well as an id, which is generated by the API. This API was built in Java 1.8.

## Usage
To use the API, access the Heroku app at https://usersapi-103018.herokuapp.com/. The application will accept the following routes:

GET /v1/users : This will return a list of all users in JSON format.

GET /v1/users/{id} : This will return the user associated with the specified ID in JSON format.

POST /v1/users : This will accept a JSON object in { firstName: "nameHere", lastName: "nameHere" } format, create a new user in the database with associated ID, and return the full user object, including ID, as JSON in the response.
